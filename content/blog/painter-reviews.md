![Reviews, Referrals, feedback - crestwood painting kansas city](/images/rave-reviews.webp) Our customers are our best advertisement!

This was a nice treat on New Years Eve - [positive feedback](/reviews/) from a lady that _didn't_ hire us! Proposal sent in Feb., Â last contact was mid-March - then this arrived in December. Fortunately, [Crestwood Painting customers](/video-testimonials/) don't have this kind of experience.

> I chose a cheaper bid. And they were a band of idiots...I am so sorry I did not hire you, and won't make that mistake in the future.

### The Review

"I was cleaning up emails at the end of the year, and found this one. I just wanted you to know that you do get what you pay for.

"I chose a cheaper bid. And they were a band of idiots. I think the spokesman was experienced, but he would take my check, leave, go to the bank, and cash it. When I told them that what is white stays white, and what is red to match the bricks stays red, I came home to find one of them painting the red downspout white. Then they painted the white garage door the house color. They promised to clean the windows, broke three storms taking them off, and put them back up dirty. What painter puts up dirty windows? Plus they didn't clean the house windows.

> They were the only ones in my home. So when someone started writing checks on one of my bank accounts, I knew it was that gang. And that set up a whole new feeling of insecurity, identity theft, and mistrust.

"They also harassed my newly married next door neighbor next door. Oh, and the job they did? No scraping, paint all over the yard, not good.

"I am so sorry I did not hire you, and won't make that mistake in the future. There have been a few people asking about a painter, since they knew I had my house done. I will pass on your name.

May the new year bring you much success, good health, and happiness.
Best regards, Barbara L
