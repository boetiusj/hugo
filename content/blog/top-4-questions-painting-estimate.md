![Paint estimate Kansas City Crestwood Painting](/images/estimate-definition.webp)The first question most homeowners ask a contractor is “Can I get an estimate?” But there really are four questions you should ask _before_ that one. The first three questions are for your contractor, the last is for you to ask yourself:

> Online reviews (testimonials, feedback, etc.) are uncensored and honest. There will likely be a balance between negative and positive. No reviews? Then you better ask lots of good questions.

- How long have you been in business? Lots of information in this answer. The John Smith that has been a painter for 25 years is not the same as John Smith Painting Company that’s been in business for 2 years. Note that "business" is very different from "experience" - and both should be verifiable. See the next question.

- Where are your reviews? Not the age-old “references”, but reviews. Let’s face it, contractors never provide references for anything other than jobs that went really well. How many jobs didn't go well? How do you know? [Online reviews (testimonials, feedback, etc.](/reviews/)) are uncensored and honest. There will likely be a balance between negative and positive. No reviews? Then you better ask lots of good questions.

> A successful contractor will have a verifiable history of delighted customers and will have confident answers to those same questions.

- How (and when) will you deliver your estimate? This will tell you much about how future dealings might go. Clear and prompt estimates indicate a level of confident professionalism that verbal or hand-written estimates do not.
- How confident am I that this contractor will _really_ do everything he says he will do? This is the old-fashioned “gut check”. If you don’t feel you can [trust a contractor](/trust-your-contractor/) he’s probably not the right person to be working in your home.

- Will he really show up on time?
- Will they really work full days?
- Can he really do the job safely?
- Do I really trust this person?

Homeowners sometimes rely on a sample of one ("my neighbor really liked this painter") and don't always ask the [tough-but-necessary questions](/12-questions-ask-painter/). A successful contractor will have a verifiable history of delighted customers and will have confident answers to those same questions.
