We transformed the [inside of a nice Brookside home]/interior-painter-kansas-city/) and the homeowner ran into exactly what's described here: colors that on one wall or time of day looked completely different than another. The homeowner was surprised, but Debby Zimmer at Paint Quality Institute explains what's going on:

"Deep, highly saturated shades have been popular for years, but the palette that’s in vogue right now is just the opposite. Interior designers and colorists are favoring lighter hues that just tease the eye with subtle hints of color.

> During the daytime, a wall color might appear to be in the pale green family, but at night, under artificial light, it may take on a yellow caste.

Vaguely reminiscent of the “pastels” of yesteryear, the light colors that are gaining popularity today are more sophisticated ensembles, often marrying three or more different hues to create soft color that is often hard to put a name to. Layering color in this way also produces some interesting visual effects.

> Because the new tints are so changeable under different lighting conditions, a useful recommendation is to apply some sizable swatches of the paint color to several of your walls and live with them for a day or two before fully committing to the color.

Because the new tints are not pure yellows, greens, or whatever, many have a chameleon-like quality, shifting their appearance slightly when the light changes.

During the daytime, a wall color might appear to be in the pale green family, but at night, under artificial light, it may take on a yellow caste. Likewise, a light bluish tint might gravitate toward pale gray in dimmer light.

Because the new tints are so [changeable under different lighting conditions]/colors-relaxation/), a useful recommendation is to apply some sizable swatches of the paint color to several of your walls and live with them for a day or two before fully committing to the color. That way, you can be sure you’ll like your new choice at every time of day or night.

The emerging trend to tints is part of the natural ebb and flow that occurs in the paint industry every five years or so, and this stage of the cycle offers some tangible rewards to those who jump on board.

For one thing, repainting walls, ceilings and woodwork in lighter-colored paint tends to “open up” the area, making any room seem more spacious.

Perhaps even more important is the psychological benefit that comes with a lighter indoor environment. Brighter surroundings can lift our spirits, no matter what the color. And soft tints derived from certain color families – green and blue, for example – have a restful quality that can be restorative after a stressful day.

If you’re truly serious about doing some interior painting, there’s no time like the present. Adding some light new paint color is the perfect antidote to winter’s shorter days and gloomier weather. You’ll be right in step with the latest trend in interior painting, and you’ll find 2016 to be a far brighter new year!”
