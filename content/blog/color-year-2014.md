![color of the year 2014](/images/color-year.webp) Some day we'll laugh about this...

New colors are declared "trendy" by those that know such things. Usually it warrants nothing more than a harrumph, but in this case it's very clear that somebody got carried away with their Barney/Cookie Monster childhood.

Where would one use such a color? Options are limited as this color will likely induce motion sickness. Maybe a roller coaster? Primary school? Dandy sport coat?

Depending on your appetite for risk you might try this paint color in your living room - but understand the in-laws might not have a positive reaction. [Last year's color](/being-green/ "Why Itâ€™s Easy Being Green") was a good bit more tolerable.

Crestwood Painting customers are a bit more courageous with color; nonetheless, this year's color of the year might be a bit much. If you do find yourself so possessed please let me know - I'll be over for a photo before we're asked to repaint.
