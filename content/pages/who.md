## We ARE No Drips, No Drama - since 2007

Consistent communication. Clear proposals, clear expectations. Friendly people work full days and keep tidy work areas.

### Fully licensed and insured

From the very beginning we've had a KCMO business license and full insurance - business liability and workman's compensation insurance. And we send a copy of that insurance along with every single proposal. So you have confidence from the get-go.

Crestwood Painting has professional certifications and affiliations. Lead-safe certified by the EPA since way back in 2011 and an active member of the [Painting Contractors Association](https://www.pcapainted.org/) since 2008.

### High Customer Ratings

Year after year, all the way back to 2007, we have rave [reviews, feedback & testimonials](/reviews/). Customers call us back and tell their friends and families their great experience.

### Schedule Driven

Best to look for a company that sets expectations for painters as effectively as those for customers. Those things that are expected of every service company, but often not delivered:

- Show up on time
- Work full days, every day
- Stay at it until the job is complete
- Clean up. And then leave.

Many of the top contractor complaints are schedule related. These include inconsistent work hours and days, inconsistent crews, inconsistent work practices. All of this means the project drags on.

### Solid People

Every company succeeds with their people. At Crestwood Painting we patiently look for the right people. Technical skills are assumed - a painter should, of course, competently sand, fill, caulk, scrape, brush and roll. We also look for the soft skills: neat appearance, courtesy, respectful of others, etc. Because when a painter is in your home you want to be confident that both your family and your home are protected and respected.

#### What's in a Name?

After starting in '07 we needed a name but the obvious "Brookside Painting" URL was taken by a company in Brooklyn. No kidding. So, a long cup of coffee with a marketing expert lead to "Home Tones". As in Home painting and Tones of color. Genius, right?

It was immediately shot down (wife and daughter: "you've got to be kidding"). They are not marketing experts, but in less than 5 minutes they decided on Crestwood Painting. Whadda ya gonna do?

#### What is No Drips, No Drama?

Early on, a homeowner saw us working down the street. After a couple of days he came over and asked for an estimate. After the usual measuring and counting he was asked: "What are you sensitive to? What do you want to avoid?"

> He said "I don't want any drama - just paint my house."

So we painted. And he paid us. And then left a great Google review. That's it.

Why do people have to ask for a No Drama experience? Because they've already had a Drama Contractor - one burn and you learn.

No Drips, No Drama means

- Clear communication - before and during
- Safe work practices
- Consistent, full-time work hours
- We own our work

Give us a call and see for yourself how pleasant it is to work with true service professionals.
