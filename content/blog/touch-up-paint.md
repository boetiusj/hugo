[![paint touch up](/images/Nail-Polish-300x300.jpg)](/2014/07/Nail-Polish.jpg)
A homeowner asked about touch-up painting for trim and kitchen cabinets - this explanation really clicked for her.

Nails usually follow a three step process:

1. Base coat
2. Color coat
3. Top coat (2X)
4. (Optional) Chip

When a chip happens there's really no easy way to make that nail look like all the rest, is there?
She had no more questions.
  
You'll notice how similar nail polish lingo is to painting lingo. Same process, really - primer, paint, and in the case of kitchen cabinets, very often a clear coat on top of everything.

Sure, you can apply paint to cover a chip, but it won't look the same without a _lot_Â of extra work. Now, if you're selling a house that might be OK - but keep this trick in mind when you're _buying_, too. What at first appears to be a well-painted home may really be nothing more than clever touch-up work. That's something that you're likely to not see until you've lived in the house for a bit.

If you've got touch up painting questions, give us a call. We're happy to help and there's usually no chipped nails in answering questions.
