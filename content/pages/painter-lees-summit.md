[![paint contractor lee's summit crestwood](images/Lees-Summit.jpg)](https://crestwoodpainting.com/cwp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lees-Summit.jpg)Crestwood has done both exterior and interior painting in Lee's Summit. Homes or offices - we take the same care in performing our work. Well-trained employees applying the very best materials. Because we use low VOC "green" paints you might not even smell our work!

Take a look at [12 Questions to Ask _Before_ You Hire a Painter](https://crestwoodpainting.com/12-questions-ask-painter/ "12 Questions to Ask Before You Hire a Painter"). Painting isn't something most people do very often so it helps to ask the right questions when you're meeting with paint contractors.

Then take a look at where we've been on the [Project Map](https://crestwoodpainting.com/map "Project Map") - maybe we've worked for your neighbor? It's also to check out what others are saying about us. Start with the [Reviews page](https://crestwoodpainting.com/reviews/ "Online Reviews – Painters in Kansas City"), then search Google, Yahoo, Yelp, Angie's List, CitySearch and others.

Under the Boring, But Important category there's insurance. Make sure you ask for, and get a current copy of  your contractor's insurance certificates. Not a homeowners policy, or an auto policy, but both business liability and workman's compensation. It's the law, it's also just a good idea.
