Removing popcorn ceilings is very much a Good News / Bad News sort of thing:

- Good News - we've had good results and [happy customers](https://crestwoodpainting.com/reviews/)
- Bad News - it may contain asbestos

> If the test sample contains no asbestos we'd be happy to discuss the options!

So, first have several samples of your ceiling material sent to a testing lab (try the nice people at [Hernly](http://www.hernly.com) in Lawrence) for analysis.

- Positive Test (ceiling material contains asbestos) - best option is to call an asbestos abatement firm. Many people, at this point, decide that removal is no longer a priority.
- If the test sample contains no asbestos we'd be happy to discuss the options!

> After popcorn is removed there will likely be damaged or poorly finished corners or joints which should be repaired.

### Popcorn Ceiling Removal Details

Popcorn texture was used as a lower cost alternative crack repair. Or, it was used to save on new construction cost of drywall finishing. Either way, removal is just the first step.

After popcorn is removed there will likely be damaged or poorly finished corners or joints which should be repaired. Then all surfaces should be sealed for a consistent appearance. An then, of course, painting comes last.

Popcorn texture removal is often part of a [larger interior painting project](https://crestwoodpainting.com/interior-painter-kansas-city/). DIY removal is sometimes an option. But, this is very much a messy, low glamour sort of project. Some people have tried to short circuit the process and just paint over the popcorn to freshen it up. Bad Move - latex paint will loosen the popcorn and some of it will peel right off.

### Cost of Popcorn Removal

After popcorn ceiling material has been tested by a certified lab it's time to think about removal. Generally, popcorn removal runs about $5 per square foot for flat ceilings. Of course, a two story vaulted ceiling will cost quite a bit more and removal for a 10' x 10' bedroom will also be quite a bit more.
