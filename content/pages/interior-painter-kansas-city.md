## Interior Painting Estimate

A clear understanding of the project is an important first step. What is the customer's vision? Which details are important - and which are not? We'll measure each room, markup photos and make sure everybody shares the same expectations.

You can expect a positive experience: a clear proposal, clear expectations and a clearly friendly and respectful crew. There are [plenty of ideas for choosing colors](/color-help/), too. We'll keep an organized work area and tidy up at the end of each day - you’ll be delighted with the results.

### The Interior Paint Process

First, we'll send a list of things you can do to help make the whole process easier. Removing smaller items, taking down artwork and electronics, etc. Also, tails and paint don't mix, best to make arrangements for pets.

Then, we protect: cover floors, cover furniture, even put up temporary partition walls if needed. We use drop cloths, heavy paper for floors and plenty of painter's tape.

Prep and paint - clean, seal, sand and prime per the written and agreed-upon Scope of Work. Then the topcoat - spray, brush or roll. Professional techniques ensure clean lines and lasting results.

### The Cost of Interior Painting

Generally, the price for professional painting in Kansas City starts at $840 per day per painter. But, like most things, there are many variables. Best to have a frank discussion about the results desired.

- What's to be painted - walls only? Trim? Ceiling, too?
- Surface condition ([plaster repair](/plaster-repair-kansas-city/) needed?)
- Color - some colors require more prep
- Ceiling height
- Furniture, etc. to move?
- Deep colors (canary yellow, electric blue) require more prep work

### Interior Paint Quality

Poor quality paint is false economy - whether in an office or a dining room. It simply doesn't hold up, doesn't clean well, doesn't cover well, etc.

- 100% acrylic paint protects longest and is easy to clean
- Premium (not builder grade) means you can purchase more if you need (paint stores often won't sell builder grade to homeowners)
- Professional work practices mean consistent sheen and even coverage.
- Scuff-resistant paint is perfect for hallway traffic.
