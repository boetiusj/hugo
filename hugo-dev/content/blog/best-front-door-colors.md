## The Focal Point

A carefully chosen front door color makes a great first impression, setting a welcoming tone and hinting at the personality of the house and its inhabitants. A classic black door might convey elegance and sophistication, while a bright blue door could signal a quirky and fun personality. Choosing a color that resonates with your style allows the house to express your individuality.

### Natural Elements

It’s best when exterior colors work well with fixed surfaces and materials like a brick or stone facade and roof color. Then, aim for a front door color that harmonizes with fixed materials as well as landscape colors to create a sense of balance and unity.
Curb appeal impact: Studies have shown that the right door color can actually increase the perceived value of a house. A Zillow survey found that prospective buyers were willing to pay more for a house with a desirable door color and less for one with an undesirable one. This impact on perceived value makes choosing the right door color especially important if you're planning to sell your house.

### Aesthetic Considerations

Paint sheen is definitely a factor with front doors. While exterior trim is often a satin sheen, most front doors are well served with a semi-gloss sheen. A front door with a bit more sheen is naturally a little dressier, a little more eye-catching.

Black doors may be classic, but can look like a dark hole on some homes. This effect is lessened somewhat with lighter surrounding colors. On the same note, a front door that is covered by a storm door (even a glass storm) will tend to look darker.

### Dark Storm Doors

Dark door colors absorb more heat - if your front door catches direct sunlight and is behind a glass storm door, well, that’s a tough environment for a painted surface. Maybe consider a lighter color in that situation.

### Clever Color Choosing

An oldie-but-goody trick is to print a photo of the front side of your house and cut out the front door. Then hold potential color chips behind the hole - you'll quickly narrow your range of choices and not have a brush to clean!
