[why painters wear whites]("/images/painters-whites.webp")
There is no single answer. Grizzled old union painters as well as younger pros all agree that professional painters in Kansas City wear "painters whites" - but there doesn't seem to be a clear history. Here are some theories:

- Whites distinguish painters from other trades.
- White indicates [cleanliness](/reviews/) to customers.
- Clean whites indicates skill to other painters.
- White and other light colors are those most commonly chosen for the widest range of applications.
- White is more comfortable in the summer sun.
- Before paint was whitewash - not as noticeable on a white uniform.
- Spackle, plaster, caulk and other common trade materials are all white.
- White clothing is economical - costs less than dyed clothing.
- Easy cleaning - white cloth can be bleached easier than colored clothing.

All of the painters at Crestwood wear painters pants and a clean Crestwood uniform shirt. Some of the guys prefer Crestwood baseball hats, some prefer floppy "bucket" hats to help stay out of the sun. Either way, the nice people at [KC Screenprint](http://www.kcscreenprint.com/) do all the embroidery.
