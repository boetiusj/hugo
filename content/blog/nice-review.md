![Online Reviews Crestwood Painting](/images/online-reviews.webp)
This was a review of the painting work we did for a new homeowner. Realtors had a very involved deal and rainy weather made this a bit of a challenge but the rain eventually stopped, the [exterior painting](/exterior-painting-kansas-city/) was soon completed and the homeowner is quite delighted!

"Crestwood Painting is an excellent example of getting what you pay for. While they were our most expensive estimate by a solid 20% over the next-highest competitor, I would absolutely (and likely will, down the line) use them again. We took a bit of a chance and chose them based on their stellar reputation and my excellent first impression during the initial estimate. I'm glad we made the choice we did. I heartily recommend their services.

The staff are exceptionally helpful and communicate plan and changes therein as they develop. You will always be kept abreast of progress, hitches in the plan, possible improvements to your home, and other issues.

> Everyone I encountered was very friendly and easy to work with. I admit that I was a particularly difficult customer, for a variety of reasons, but Crestwood took all the flak I and my realtor could throw at them in stride. They were always professional and worked hard to make sure I was satisfied with progress and the results.

I am certainly very happy with the work Crestwood Painting did. They scraped the house well and painted fairly quickly, despite being repeatedly delayed by rain. As they worked, they were very clean and kept their tools organized when not at the house. They truly go above and beyond to make sure you're happy with the work they've done, and they will fix anything (within reason, obviously) that you have a problem with immediately and without question. After the work is all done, they follow up regularly in case you've found some aspects of the job you're unhappy with. That said, don't plan on having to chase them to fix anything. They do fantastic work. Our home looks amazing.

Overall, Crestwood Painting is the outfit to contact if you want your painting done right. If you want a quick, cheap job, you're looking in the wrong place. If it's lasting quality, professionalism, and general excellence you're after, give them a call. You'll be happy you did."

Our painters take pride in their good work, but their reward is all the more special when the happy customer is so appreciative.
