People sometimes assume a painter can stop by, check out their house and leave an estimate in the mail box. Here's what can go wrong with that approach.

Most [exterior paint projects](/exterior-paint-important/) will cost several thousand dollars. A contractor that drops off a quick price is likely to give that very same level of attention to _your_ project should he get the job.

But, how confident are you

- That you'll get everything you expect?
- That the job will be completed safely?
- That they've got the business skill to complete the job
- That you'll have a [No Hassle and No Drama](/video-testimonials/) experience?

Every homeowner wants a professionally completed project at a very attractive price. But price is only one factor - most people will be very unhappy if they pay less and then also _get_ less. Â What's your level of trust? What's your gut say?

- [Who are their workers](/crestwood-people/)?
- What's the track record?
- What's their attention to detail?
- Do they show up on time?
- Do they work _every_ day?
- Can the clearly communicate?

It's important to get to know (and be confident in) whom you'll be doing business with. That's why our Crestwood Painting proposal will come _after_ we've completely discussed both your expectations and the available options. Call us today - and tell us how you do business.
