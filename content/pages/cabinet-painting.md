## The Heart of Your Home

Kitchen cabinets see a lot of action. Styles change, wear and tear happens and a fresh coat is in order. Generally, a new look is preferrable to a new kitchen.

> Crestwood Painting did a wonderful job on my kitchen cabinets. They gave an accurate and fair estimate, worked full days, and were extremely neat and courteous. They also worked during regular business hours so we could be out of the house.

### The Cabinet Painting Process

First, there's a careful esti­mate - mea­sure­ments and some questions. Then a frank discussion of what we can and cannot do so you have clear expectations.

Step 2.
You’ll get a clear, com­pre­hen­sive pro­pos­al. Don’t wor­ry: we’ll out­line every step and stage with­out any fuzzy details or hid­den surprises.

Step 3.
We’ll pre­p everything: cov­er floors, cov­er coun­ters, mask sur­faces, etc.

Step 4.
Then, the labor-inten­sive process. Clean­ing, degreas­ing, sand­ing, repairs, prim­ing and finally the top­coat. Every detail matters.

Step 5.
Once the paint­ing is com­plete, we'll care­ful­ly rein­stall the doors and draw­ers and then door pulls and knobs. We’ll also make any need­ed touch-ups before a final walk-through with you.

### The Cost to Paint Cabinets in Kansas City

Depends, of course as there are a LOT of variables. Generally, Kansas City kitchens are in the $3500 to $8000 range. Or more.

The advantages of painting? It's usually three to five days but there's no tear-out, no mess and no plumbing. Of course, [bathroom vanities](/does-unfinished-cabinetry-pay/) can be painted too.

### Paint For Kitchen Cabinets

Professional grade, water-based products are tough-as-nails and very low odor. Water-based products are more flexible than older oil-based painted and they don't yellow either. A sprayed finish means no brush marks and more consistent coverage.

Oak grain cabinets typically show a more open grain. We can discuss option to minimize the grain appearance.
