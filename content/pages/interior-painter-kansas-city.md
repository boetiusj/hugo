### The Cost of Interior Painting

Generally, the price for professional painting in Kansas City starts at $840 per day per painter, including tools and some paint. But, like most things, there are several factors that affect the price. Best to just have a frank discussion about those factors and how they play into a budget discussion.

- What *exactly* will be painted - walls, ceiling, trim or all?
- Surface condition ([plaster repair](/plaster-repair-kansas-city/) needed?)
- Color change
- Ceiling height
- Furniture, etc. to move?
- Deep colors (canary yellow, electric blue) require more prep work

Sometimes it can be tough to evaluate different proposals: this one includes paint, that one charges extra for materials. Here's a [little help when comparing proposals.](/compare-paint-bids/) Info hound? Take a look at our [Frequently Asked Questions](/faqs/).

### Interior Paint Quality

Poor quality paint is false economy - whether in an office or a dining room. It simply doesn't hold up, doesn't clean well, doesn't cover well, etc.

- 100% acrylic paint protects longest and is easy to clean
- Professional work practices mean consistent sheen and even coverage.
- Scuff-resistant paint is perfect for hallway traffic.
