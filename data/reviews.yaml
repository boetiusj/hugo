  review: "Top quality client-driven painting contractor. We are pleased with the experience and results! Our house never looked better - not even when we bought it! Honest, professional, big enough to meet our needs with adequate personnel to deliver results and finish in a timely fashion. Small enough to be dealing with the owner throughout. Crestwood are folks we will be glad to recommend to others."

  review: We have now used Crestwood for another painting project! We had our dining room painted. Ben worked efficiently and cleanly and it looks amazing! He showed up early and was very professional. I am so pleased with the finished product!

  headline: Two projects... incredibly happy
  date: January 2020
  review: I've used Crestwood Painting for two projects - exterior and interior and been incredibly happy with their service and quality. When we bid our exterior painting their cost was not the cheapest or highest and we selected them based on positive referrals from neighbors. Mike and Ben were so great to work with I didn't even bid our interior work - I went straight to them. They painted our interior while we were on vacation and I was totally comfortable giving Ben access to our house even when we weren't there. With a 100-year-old house there is rarely a straightforward project and Mike provided advice on the best way to approach our projects. When we had a few minor issues, they were resolved quickly with no hesitation. I would absolutely use them again and recommend then to our friends.

#  review: "Mike is that rarest of contractors: He provides a budget then stays within in. He makes a plan, communicates that plan, then follows through on the timing. I have had a lot of rehab and renovation work done over the years, and rarely does a contractor deliver in these ways. Moreover, perhaps most importantly, Mike's painting crew was thoughtful and professional. When issues arose, which they always do on 100-year-old homes, Mike's lead painter studied the problem, determined a solution, then communicated both to me. I was pleased in every aspect of this service."
