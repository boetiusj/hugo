    <p>Heavy cast steel table in perfect condition.<br>
This saw has been well cared for (polished, babied and loved for over 20 years), purchased as a young homeowner at Sutherland's on Wornall. No longer in woodworking mode, It should go to another good home.<br>

Included:
<ul>
<li>Factory stand</li>
<li>Rolling dolly</li>
<li>Vega Pro 50 fence and related hardware</li>
<li>Original left table</li>
<li>Right table extension has opening for router plate, wired and switched for power, port for dust collector.</li>

<li>Original throat plate</li>
<li>All nuts and bolts</li>

The saw has been disassembled for moving - all (I think) parts are there, but the motor, fence and side router table will have to be assembled.
