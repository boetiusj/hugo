[![Overused words](images/Overused.jpg)](https://crestwoodpainting.com/cwp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Overused.jpg)Like, whatever! Know what I'm sayin'?

Some of the [over-used](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23362207)Â words for 2013. Example: "As artisan painters, Crestwood strives for world-class performance 24/7. At the end of the day, we follow best practices to build our brand. Whatever." Here's another: Our painters may take a selfie with your dog, but there will be absolutely no twerking."

Some of these seemed, at least to me, to have a very hyper-business 80's ring to them (world class - is that still around?). Literally.

Anyway, the most annoying is, literally, "anyway." This is the heavy-handed transition from Person A's conversational interjection to Person B's more important subject matter - usually themselves. Oiy.

So if you choose to call one of our paint hipsters, we'll absolutely be responsible stewards for your legacy project. And trust that you'll make the call to Sherwin Williams about the gluten-free nature of their paint. Yeah.
