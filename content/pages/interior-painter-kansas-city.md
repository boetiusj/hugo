## The Cost of Interior Painting

Generally, the price for professional painting in Kansas City starts at $680 per day per painter, including tools and some paint. But, like most things, there are several factors that affect the price. Best to just have a frank discussion about those factors and how they play into a budget discussion. Among them:

- What will be painted - walls, ceiling, trim or all?
- Surface condition ([plaster repair]/plaster-repair-kansas-city/) needed?)
- Color change
- Ceiling height
- Furniture, etc. to move?
- Deep colors (lipstick red, electric blue) require more prep work

## Paint for Interiors

Poor quality paint is false economy - whether in an office or a dining room. It simply doesn't hold up, doesn't clean well, doesn't cover well, etc.

- 100% acrylic paint protects longest and is easy to clean
- Professional work practices mean consistent sheen and even coverage
