This brand new senior health center in Olathe, KS was painted safely and ahead of schedule. A clear plan was key.

When searching for an exterior painting contractor that's got experience with commercial work it's important to know the risks. A few drips near the dumpster is no big deal but a contractor that speckles every car in the parking lot? - everybody in the office will be talking about that.

Proof of proper insurance, sure - but also consistent training and screening of employees.  Conscientious employees that have been trained to follow a clear Scope of Work are almost certain to meet expectations. No gaps in information, no assumptions.

## Top 5 Commercial Exterior Painting Concerns

1. Disruption - we'll work around entrances at off-peak times and will work with your staff to ensure proper communication about work flow. There's usually caution tape where appropriate and signage to advise and direct traffic.
2. Noise - painting shouldn't disrupt. Clear communication means expectations are clear for all involved. Best to let us know if we need to avoid an area at certain times so exterior painting doesn't distract your staff.

Aerial lifts allow efficient painting and avoids the distractions of noisy ladders.

- Safety - Our written Safety Manual, low Mod Rate and regular training all mean your office will see desired results without any scares.

- Security - Do you require contractors adhere to access protocols? Name badges, background verification, etc.? We've done it before.

- Site Considerations - these are the items unique to your project. These might range from where contractors typically park to special directions regarding alarms. Every project is unique and it's important to take time to be responsive to special concerns.

## Cost of Commercial Exterior Painting

"It depends" is the first qualifier when talking about the price of commercial exterior painting. Just like [cost of office painting](/office-painting-experts/) there are several factors in play - here are a few:

- Building size (directly drives paint cost)
- Building height (ladders OK? Or lift needed?)
- Access restrictions - trees, power lines, other buildings, etc.
- Surface condition / profile - rough surfaces require more paint
- Repairs needed
- Obstacles (landscaping, fences, etc.) - affects application efficiency
- Doors, trim or decorative elements
- Number of colors
- Masking required (signs, etc.)
- Material choice
- Budget

We'll go through our commercial painting checklist to be sure to cover the top priorities as well as any factors unique to the project. After careful measurements are taken we'll go over the factors that affect budget and timing.

As a rule of thumb, commercial painting in Kansas City starts at $1200 for small projects; the scale changes quite a bit with larger projects like those pictured. Give us a call and we'll let you know how efficient we can be with your project.

Commercial maintenance painting: Safety yellow paint helps heavy equipment to steer clear.

### The Process

We start with safety - identify and discuss any obstructions that might affect the work (overhead power lines, landscaping, fences, etc.) as well as any internal safety or access protocols.

Then we'll establish a base to operate from - a location that allows efficient painting but doesn't interfere with your day-to-day. This is where we'll store ladders, equipment and materials. Then we'll get to work cleaning surfaces so they're ready for painting.

They say a Job Well Planned is Half Delivered. So, we establish a sequencing plan: what gets painted and when. After that, exterior painting proceeds in an orderly manner: surface cleaning and repair, surface and area protection, material application, detail work, clean-up and review.

### About Our Painters

It's important that the contractor you hire makes your people feel comfortable and safe. That's why we run background checks on our employees - to be sure that sketchy pasts don't sneak through, yes - but also to make sure each of our employees reflects our Core Values:

- Safety
- Accountability
- Effectiveness
- Respect For Others
- Do the Right Thing, Not the Easy Thing

Crestwood Painting screens our applicants so that you’ll only have the kind of painters your business staff can feel safe with. Nice people that enjoy their co-workers and take pride in doing a great job. Our employees wear professional painters’ whites paints and Crestwood uniform shirts and will communicate clearly should your people have any questions.

Safety matters so we make sure to [train our employees](/crestwood-people/) on how to safely work in commercial environments. Fall protection training, lift training - sure. But also training for hot and cold weather, safety harness use, sprayer safety . We’ll use caution tape and orange cones to direct people and traffic appropriately. people don’t wind up in our wet paint. Drop cloths when they’re needed, doors closed where possible. We’re even equipped to set up temporary barrier walls if that’s a better option.

### What if There's a Problem?

What separates a good painting contractor (or business or anything else) is how things are handles when they don't go well. Wrong color? - that's pretty straightforward. Weather? - normally a matter of clear communication and scheduling. Injury? - again, communication and scheduling.

The key is proactive handling. Be up front - acknowledge the problem, propose a solution and get to it. Sometimes, our well-trained and experienced painters can sometimes make a goof. So we fix it – right there, on the spot.

Sometimes problems develop because of missed expectations - "But I assumed you would...". This is where a clear proposal can go a long way. The same clear and precise language used in our Proposals is the exact language we copy into our internal Scope of Work. Everybody has the same information and expectations - no finger-pointing, just moving forward to a completed project.
